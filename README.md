# Taquin-Game:
Taquin Game (Development using SDL2 in C)
nov. 2022 - déc. 2022
In this project, I developed a Taquin game using the SDL2 library and the C programming language. The game featured a graphical user interface, allowing players to move tiles and rearrange the board to solve the puzzle.I was in charge of designing the game (7 windows) and help in some programming tasks.
